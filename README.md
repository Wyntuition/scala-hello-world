# Getting Started with Scala

1. Ensure you have Java 1.8 or higher by running: `javac -version`

1. Install sbt (on MacOS, run `brew install sbt`)

1. Create a new folder for your source and run `sbt new scala/hello-world`

1. Run the project by going into the hello-world-template folder and running `sbt` then `~run` in the console. The ~ is optional and causes sbt to re-run on every file save allowing to a rapid development workflow.
